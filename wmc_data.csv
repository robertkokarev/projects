And what can it do in conjunction with government? These were some of the questions discussed during the “Unplugged” session at the recent Investec Wealth Forum in Johannesburg on 8 August. | The panel, which was moderated by journalist, radio and TV presenter Redi Tlhabi, featured Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank; Stephen Koseff, Chief Executive of Investec Group and Fani Titi, Chairman of Investec. | While the state has an important role to play in setting and driving development goals, it’s crucial that this is underpinned by the highest standards of governance within state owned enterprises, our panel noted. | Furthermore, the State should help to create a climate of confidence in the system that will allow business to be an effective partner in achieving these goals; this includes allowing business to deliver certain essential services where it can do so more reliably and cheaply than the state. | Here’s a breakdown of what topics are discussed when in this video:  |  | • 07:00: Stephen Koseff on the collaboration between government and business, the CEO Forum initiatives and how crucial business is to drive growth | • 01:35: Lesetja Kganyago on why State-Owned Enterprises should be privatised if they can deliver more reliable and cheaper services to help government deliver on its development roles  | • 03:50: Fani Titi on “accelerated inclusive growth” vs “radical economic transformation” | • 05:44: For a growth economy, “you need business to run with the ball” – Stephen Koseff | • 06:19: Lesetja Kganyago on the need for “political will and political leadership to drive a reform programme” | • 07:24: Lesetja Kganyago on how the treasury employs some of the “finest minds” in the country and how they should be left alone to do their job | • 08:00: Unemployed young people should not be viewed as a problem, they should be seen as a valuable resource pool with which to grow this country, says Lesetja Kganyago |  | Get more insights and videos from the Investec Wealth Forum here: http://invest.ec/2wWpkwK",,,,Film & Animation,"Lesetja Kganyago,Stephen Koseff,Redi Tlhabi,Fani Titi,Investec Wealth Forum,Investec,Kganyago,Koseff,Tlhabi,#InvestecWealth",,2,0,21,

Embracing pressure and communicating, he says, are key to ensuring team buy-in and clarity. Paul explains how his role as captain involved filtering big amounts of data and working that into a cohesive plan.  |  | “Intuition isn’t enough,” he says, “a structured plan that allows for flexibility is paramount to enabling a leader to react appropriately.” |  | Paul also says that there’s no right way to captain. He learnt a lot from the great captains of the past, including those that he’s played under like Jose Maria Olazabal. “You do what you believe is right for your personality and how you see things. You’ve been put into a position to lead, now lead,” Jose told Paul in the lead up the 2014 Ryder Cup. |  | With Europe having won seven of the nine Ryder Cup tournaments prior to Paul’s captaincy, he mentions that it’s important to take a winning template and to evolve it. “Like life and business, there needs to be evolution in what you do. If you stand still, you’re going backwards”. He talks about the challenges of expectation, being favourites and playing at home for the first time. “When people expect you to do something, you’ve got nowhere to go. A lot of the passion that’s driven us to win Ryder Cups has come from lots of space to move into,” he says. |  | Paul talks about how positioning in the media was critical to setting expectation, not only in the minds of the public, but in the minds of the players themselves. “It’s always easier being the hunter than the hunted,” he explains. “Like a boxer I wanted us to be on the front foot, be a little gung-ho”. |  | “Emotion and passion are essential in anything you do in life. If you don’t have passion it makes it hard to be successful because you don’t go the extra mile”. He believes passion is the underlying fundamental behind people’s success and happiness.",,,,Sports,"Paul McGinley,Ryder Cup,Ryder Cup 2014,Ryder Cup Captain,Investec,Investec golf,Investec golfers,Investec Specialist Bank,Golf,Golf strategy,winning strategy,winning,golfers,golf winners",,2,0,22,

That was the first time I had heard about Investec. |  | I was quite nervous about the interview because I had never had one before. But the big smiles on Setlogane Manchidi and Linsey Sherman's faces eased my nerves as soon as they entered the room. They were very friendly and patient with me. |  | Impact |  | The mentorship programme has been of great help to me. I was mentored by people who are as successful as I would like to be one day. I enjoyed learning about challenges and opportunities that one encounters in the real world of work. |  | I also participated in the Enke: Make your mark programme, and attended a camp where we were taught and trained to go back to our respective communities and to take action to alleviate issues that South Africa faces. I met a lot of my peers, who gave me courage and strength because they shared a common goal - to make this country a better place. |  | Highlights and memories |  | My best memory is these words that Setlogane Manchidi said: ''In life you need to be very good at what you do so that no one can avoid or escape you''. I was stunned by his energetic nature. |  | Investec is... |  | ...One of the most active companies of its kind, in humanitarian causes, that I know of. I see activities on TV sponsored by Investec, and I'm proud that I'm sponsored by the same company. |  | Highlights and memories |  | When I was job-shadowing at Investec, the diversity of professions I was taken through in different divisions astounded me. Seeing the fluctuating stock market values on computers in the portfolio management department captured me the most. |  | Lessons learnt |  | One of the most important lessons I learned was to focus on my strengths rather than my weaknesses. Investec has also taught me that action speaks better than words. I've also learned to look out for those in need and assist as much as I can.

At the time I was just a young school boy from the township, highly passionate about bands and drum majorettes but only exposed to soccer and marimba groups. A friend of mine introduced me to the Field Band, where I started off and travelled the world as a drummer. I then became a tutor and advanced to the Soweto Band Coordinator in the year 2012. I became involved in the band as a drummer to pursue my passion in music and grew further to help the youth pursue their passion in music through the Field Band. |  | Impact |  | Investec supported our HIV/AIDS programme and six years later funded two of our projects in Soweto and Alexandra. The support from Investec has helped shape the Field Band into the organisation that it is today and we are truly humbled by this. |  | Being involved in the programme has not only helped me to do what I love, but has also enabled me to instill skills and discipline in my learners and further my studies. |  |   | Memories and highlights |  | We were involved in the Investec advert, as well as the Tottenham Hotspur workshops, where we met soccer players like Bongani Khumalo and Steven Pienaar. |  | I was also fortunate enough to have toured with the band to Belgium, Amsterdam and Norway in 2008 and 2009. I toured both because of the Field Band national tour as well as pursuing my studies in music and leadership. Winning the national Field Band championships in 2011 and completing my Music Teaching Diploma were big highlights as well. |  | Investec... |  | ...places a strong emphasis on education and entrepreneurship. Social investment and I think the company truly empowers disadvantaged communities that facilitate social growth and upliftment remains their objective. |  | The road ahead |  | I am currently studying and co-ordinating the Soweto Band. I also aim to continue to enrich the lives of the youth in my community through the skills I have acquired in the Field Band. I am also furthering my studies in Teaching Methodology, Music Technology, Music Theory and Music Business.",,,,Sports,"Music,Investec,Field Band,Soweto,Alexandra,South Africa,Bongani Goliath,HIV/AIDS Programme,School,Discipline,Skills,Studies",,0,0,7,
